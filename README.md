#December Christmas Coding Challenges 2024!

Welcome to my **December Coding Challenge** repository! Each day of December, I'll (hopefully) tackle a new coding problem and share my solutions here.

Day 1: \n
        Time took-1.5 hours \n
        difficulty level: 3/10 -not too bad, I was just slow

Day 2: \n
        time took- 1.5 hours
        difficulty level: 4.5/10 -the bubble sort and figuring out how to incorperate all the rules was time consuming

Day 3: \n
        start: 8:30pm
        finish: 9:52pm 
        total: 1.5 hours

        Learned about patterns and matches in the regex package, and how to find certain phrases in a string

        difficulty level: 5/10 - Had to use some help from the AI because I didn't know how to use the regex package. Definitely a bit of a learning curve but I do believe I'll have a much easier time the next time I have a similar question.

Day 4: \n
        start: 10:00am
        finish: idk
        total time: 2.5 hours

        difficulty level: 9/10 - genuinly couldn't solve it, I had to use chat gpt in the end, I was just so lost about what to do, and I spent an hour just trying to convert a string array to a char array. Anyways, I failed, but I'll do another attempt later without AI. 


Day 5: \n
        start: 2:50pm
        finish: 5:33pm
        total time: 2.5 hours

        difficulty level: 6/10 - I learned about adjacency lists and how it works. Used AI again to help but mainly for its pseudocode, so I didn't quite copy and paste everything compared to last time.
