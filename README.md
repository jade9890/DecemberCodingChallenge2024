#December Christmas Coding Challenges 2024!

Welcome to my **December Coding Challenge** repository! Each day of December, I'll (hopefully) tackle a new coding problem and share my solutions here.

Day 1: Time took-1.5 hours
        difficulty level: 3/10 -not too bad, I was just slow
Day 2: time took- 1.5 hours
        difficulty level: 4.5/10 -the bubble sort and figuring out how to incorperate all the rules was time consuming
