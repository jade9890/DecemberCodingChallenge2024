#December Christmas Coding Challenges 2024!

Welcome to my **December Coding Challenge** repository! Each day of December, I'll (hopefully) tackle a new coding problem and share my solutions here.

Day 1: 
        Time took-1.5 hours 

        difficulty level: 3/10 -not too bad, I was just slow

Day 2: 
        time took- 1.5 hours

        difficulty level: 4.5/10 -the bubble sort and figuring out how to incorperate all the rules was time consuming

Day 3: 
        start: 8:30pm
        finish: 9:52pm 
        total: 1.5 hours

        Learned about patterns and matches in the regex package, and how to find certain phrases in a string

        difficulty level: 5/10 - Had to use some help from the AI because I didn't know how to use the regex package. Definitely a bit of a learning curve but I do believe I'll have a much easier time the next time I have a similar question.

Day 4: 
        start: 10:00am
        finish: idk
        total time: 2.5 hours

        difficulty level: 9/10 - genuinly couldn't solve it, I had to use chat gpt in the end, I was just so lost about what to do, and I spent an hour just trying to convert a string array to a char array. Anyways, I failed, but I'll do another attempt later without AI. 


Day 5: 
        start: 2:50pm
        finish: 5:33pm
        total time: 2.5 hours

        difficulty level: 6/10 - I learned about adjacency lists and how it works. Used AI again to help but mainly for its pseudocode, so I didn't quite copy and paste everything compared to last time. 

Day 6: 
        start: 3:33pm
        finish:6:30pm
        total time:2.5 hours (I ate food)

        Objective: find all positions the guard will visit before leaving the mapped area (input)
        difficulty level: 4/10. Not too bad, I just needed help with some of the syntax inside the method. But I literally spent almost an hour trying to figure out a bug it was so annoying and chat was being so stupid, 


Day 7:
        start: 4:44pm 
        finish: 9:19
        total time: 2.5 hours (I took a long break hah)

        Objective: (use backtracking) determine which equations can be made valid by inserting the operators + and * between the given numbers (evaluated strictly left-to-right) to produce the specified test value. Then, sum up the test values of all valid equations to calculate the total calibration result. 

        difficulty level: 6/10, I managed to make the string array, convert to int array, and everything else, but needed help with the backtrack method. I just wasn't sure how to properly use it. I did research and knew it was based on recursion but I was still confused. Not horrible though. 

Day 8:
        start: 4:48pm
        finish: 8:38pm
        total time: 2.5 - 3 hours (took multiple breaks)

        Objective: implement collinearity detection to find antinodes in a grid. (cross product)

        difficulty level: 6/10? Implementing hashmaps are also new to me so I needed help with the syntax, such as using the get and put functions, creating the hashmap, iterating through the keys and accessing the values within the keys. But everything else I did by myself, like figuring out how to put the antinodes in the correct place, how to correctly increase the count, etc. 

Day 9:
        start: 12:32pm
        finish:
        total time:

        Objective: String manipulation. Compact all file blocks on a disk to eliminate gaps and calculate a checksum based on the positions and IDs of the compacted file blocks.

        difficulty level: 4/10. Wasn't too bad, I had a little bug because I used the wrong length, and I needed some help making it more efficient because at first it was o(n^2). Just so you know, I have an exam soon that I've totally given up on so I'm just gonna keep my streak lol.
        
Day 10:
        start: 3:45pm
        finish: gave up
        total time: gave up

        Objective: I genuinely don't even know why I can't seem to solve this problem. I tried BFS and the count wasn't working properly due to a multitude of reasons, tried queues, linked lists, literally everything. This was unfortunately a fail. I'm also running on 2 hours of sleep, no food, and utter exhaustioin so this may have clouded my thinking slightly. But seriously I give up.

Day 11:
        start: 5:00pm
        finish:
        total time: failed 

        Objective: Array manipulation/ dynamic list transformations. Spent over 3 hours but genuinely couldnt figure out a way to solve this without getting an infinite loop 

Day 12
        start: 1:40pm
        finish: 4:38pm
        total time: 3 hours

        Objective: use DFS and hashmaps to split each plant region up, count perimeter and area and get the total cost by multiply the 2 values and adding all the costs up. 

        difficulty level: 8/10. I almost gave up because the past 2 days have been fails, but I'm glad I kept going and finished even though it took forever to do. Needed help with implementing the DFS because originally I just did a simply key and value with no regions so for the plant I, it was just one whole thing instead of 2 parts.

Day 13
        start: 10:30pm
        finish:
        total time:

        Objective: win as many prizes as possible from a set of claw machines while minimizing the total number of tokens spent. Practice optimization and use mathematic equations.

        difficulty level: 7/10. So from the beginning I already messed up because I didn't read the question properly, but all in all, I think I just need to fix my method and tweak the rest of it. It's actually not a great piece of code and it doesn't even work, but I have way too many exams to be spending multiple hours figuring this out.


Day 14:
        start: 10am
        finish: 10:50am
        total time: 50 minutes

        Objective: count the total number of robots per quadrant of array.
        Difficulty level: 4/10. Not too bad, nothing was brand new to me other than the equation to get the robots to move per second. Used an array list and a private class for the robot attribute, constructor, and move method.
