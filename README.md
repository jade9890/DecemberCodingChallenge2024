#December Christmas Coding Challenges 2024!

Welcome to my **December Coding Challenge** repository! Each day of December, I'll (hopefully) tackle a new coding problem and share my solutions here.

Day 1: 
        Time took-1.5 hours 

        difficulty level: 3/10 -not too bad, I was just slow

Day 2: 
        time took- 1.5 hours

        difficulty level: 4.5/10 -the bubble sort and figuring out how to incorperate all the rules was time consuming

Day 3: 
        start: 8:30pm
        finish: 9:52pm 
        total: 1.5 hours

        Learned about patterns and matches in the regex package, and how to find certain phrases in a string

        difficulty level: 5/10 - Had to use some help from the AI because I didn't know how to use the regex package. Definitely a bit of a learning curve but I do believe I'll have a much easier time the next time I have a similar question.

Day 4: 
        start: 10:00am
        finish: idk
        total time: 2.5 hours

        difficulty level: 9/10 - genuinly couldn't solve it, I had to use chat gpt in the end, I was just so lost about what to do, and I spent an hour just trying to convert a string array to a char array. Anyways, I failed, but I'll do another attempt later without AI. 


Day 5: 
        start: 2:50pm
        finish: 5:33pm
        total time: 2.5 hours

        difficulty level: 6/10 - I learned about adjacency lists and how it works. Used AI again to help but mainly for its pseudocode, so I didn't quite copy and paste everything compared to last time. 

Day 6: 
        start: 3:33pm
        finish:6:30pm
        total time:2.5 hours (I ate food)

        Objective: find all positions the guard will visit before leaving the mapped area (input)
        difficulty level: 4/10. Not too bad, I just needed help with some of the syntax inside the method. But I literally spent almost an hour trying to figure out a bug it was so annoying and chat was being so stupid, 


Day 7:
        start: 4:44pm 
        finish: 9:19
        total time: 2.5 hours (I took a long break hah)

        Objective: (use backtracking) determine which equations can be made valid by inserting the operators + and * between the given numbers (evaluated strictly left-to-right) to produce the specified test value. Then, sum up the test values of all valid equations to calculate the total calibration result. 

        difficulty level: 6/10, I managed to make the string array, convert to int array, and everything else, but needed help with the backtrack method. I just wasn't sure how to properly use it. I did research and knew it was based on recursion but I was still confused. Not horrible though. 

Day 8:
        start: 4:48pm
        finish: 8:38pm
        total time: 2.5 - 3 hours (took multiple breaks)

        Objective: implement collinearity detection to find antinodes in a grid. (cross product)

        difficulty level: 6/10? Implementing hashmaps are also new to me so I needed help with the syntax, such as using the get and put functions, creating the hashmap, iterating through the keys and accessing the values within the keys. But everything else I did by myself, like figuring out how to put the antinodes in the correct place, how to correctly increase the count, etc.
